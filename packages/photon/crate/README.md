Photon is a high-performance Rust image processing library, which compiles to WebAssembly, allowing for 
safe, blazing-fast image processing both natively and on the web. 

### Features 
- **Fast:** Photon outperforms even the fastest of libraries, including ImageMagick. On the web, its high-performance allows for near-native-speed image processing on the web. Benchmarks coming soon.
- **Call with JS:** Want to use Photon on the web or with Node? Using a simple npm package, you're good to go. Get all the benefits of WebAssembly
with zero-cost abstraction. 
- **Use Natively:** For command-line apps, native photo editing apps, and so forth, Photon's core codebase is in Rust, allowing for cross-platform
development.

### Functionality
96+ customisable functions are available. 

Resize, transform, correct, and filter images: apply as many effects as desired. 

Functions include:
- **Image correction**: Hue rotation, sharpening, brightness adjustment, adjusting saturation, lightening/darkening all within various colour spaces. 
- **Convolutions**: Sobel filters, blurs, Laplace effects, edge detection, etc., 
- **Channel manipulation**: Increasing/decreasing RGB channel values, swapping channels, removing channels, etc.
- **Transform**: Resize, crop, rotate and flip images.
- **Monochrome effects**: Duotoning, greyscaling of various forms, thresholding, sepia, averaging RGB values
- **Colour manipulation**: Work with the image in various colour spaces such as HSL, LCh, and sRGB, and adjust the colours accordingly. 
- **Filters**: Over 30 pre-set filters available, incorporating various effects and transformations.
- **Text**: Apply text to imagery in artistic ways, or to watermark, etc.,
- **Watermarking**: Watermark images in multiple formats. 
- **Blending**: Blend images together using 10 different techniques, change image backgrounds. 

## Install
### Native
Add the following line to the dependencies section of your Rust project's Cargo.toml:

###### Cargo.toml
```toml
[dependencies]
photon-rs = "0.3.2"
``` 

### Web
Install Photon as an npm module:

```bash
npm install --save @silvia-odwyer/photon
```

### Node.JS
To install Photon as an npm module for Node.JS use:

```bash
npm install --save @silvia-odwyer/photon-node
```

#### Using Photon Natively 
The following code opens an image from the filesystem, applies an effect, and saves it.

Here is a code sample to get you started:

```rs
extern crate photon_rs;
use photon_rs::native::{open_image, save_image};

fn main() {
    // Open the image (a PhotonImage is returned)
    let mut img = open_image("test_image.png");

    // Increment the red channel by 40
    photon_rs::channels::alter_red_channel(&mut img, 40);

    // Write file to filesystem.
    save_image(img, "raw_image.jpg");    

}
```

[For more examples, check out the guide on how to get started with Photon natively.](https://silvia-odwyer.github.io/photon/guide/using-photon-natively/)

#### Using Photon On The Web 

## Modules 
Photon contains a series of modules, which include:

- `effects`: Various image effects, including adding offsets, thresholding, duotoning, solarization, etc.,
- `channels`: Functions related to increasing/decreasing the red, green, and blue channels of the image data.
- `transform`: Resize, crop, flip, and rotate images.
- `filters`: Preset filters, which alter the RGB channels of the image. Contains over 20. 
- `conv`: Laplace, Sobel, emboss; image proc functions which require image convolution. 
-  `noise`: Noise generation of varying tints and hues. 
- `multiple`: A module for dealing with multiple images, such as watermarking images, etc.,
- `correction`: Hue rotation, adjusting saturation, lightening/darkening: all techniques available in multiple colour spaces, which lead to varying effects.

All effects and filters can be viewed below and on the official website.

### Run Examples
Clone this crate's official GitHub repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/silvia-odwyer/photon
```

Run the binary, which will perform an image processing function on an image:
```sh
cd crate
cargo run --release 
```

Compare the original image with the outputted image, and you'll see the desired effect has been applied.
